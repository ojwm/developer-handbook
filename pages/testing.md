Choosing the appropriate test tools is important; if the team enjoys using the tools, there will be more appetite to write good tests.

Not all the following tests will be applicable to every software product.

## Unit tests

## Regression tests

## Integration tests

## Accessibility tests

## Performance tests

## Penetration tests

## Manual tests

## Coverage

Test coverage should be agreed upon by the team and should be set at a level that is high enough to catch bugs but not so high that it becomes too much of a chore to write tests.
